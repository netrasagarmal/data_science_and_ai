* **Random Forest:** A bagging algorithm that uses decision trees as base models and also samples a random subset of features for each tree.

### Boosting
* **AdaBoost (Adaptive Boosting):** Sequentially trains weak learners (e.g., shallow trees), giving more weight to data points that were misclassified by previous models.
* **Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM):** Sequentially builds models where each new model corrects the errors of the previous one by fitting to the residual errors.

## Reinforcement Learning (RL)
An agent learns to make optimal decisions by interacting with an environment and receiving rewards or penalties for its actions.

* **SARSA (State-Action-Reward-State-Action):** A model-free, value-based algorithm similar to Q-Learning, but it's "on-policy" (it updates its Q-values based on the action it actually takes).
* **Deep Q-Network (DQN):** A combination of Q-Learning with deep neural networks, allowing it to handle high-dimensional state spaces (like pixels from a game).
* **Policy Gradient Methods (e.g., REINFORCE):** A policy-based method that directly learns and optimizes the agent's policy (its decision-making function).
* **Actor-Critic Methods (e.g., A2C, A3C):** A hybrid method that combines value-based (Critic) and policy-based (Actor) approaches. The Actor decides which action to take, and the Critic evaluates how good that action was.
* **PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization):** An advanced policy gradient method that improves training stability by limiting the size of policy changes at each step.
* **DDPG (Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient):** An actor-critic method for continuous action spaces.
* **Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF):** A technique that uses human feedback to train a reward model, which is then used to fine-tune an agent (prominently used in large language models).

## Deep Learning
A subfield of machine learning based on artificial neural networks with multiple layers (deep architectures). These architectures can be used for supervised, unsupervised, and other learning tasks.
* **Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) / Deep Feed-Forward Networks:** The most basic deep learning architecture, consisting of an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer.
* **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN):** Highly effective for processing grid-like data, such as images. They use convolutional layers to automatically learn spatial hierarchies of features.
* **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN):** Designed to work with sequential data (e.g., time series, text). They have "memory" in the form of loops that allow information to persist. (e.g., **LSTM**, **GRU**)
* **Autoencoders (AE):** An unsupervised neural network used for dimensionality reduction and feature learning. It consists of an encoder (compresses data) and a decoder (reconstructs data). (e.g., **Variational Autoencoders - VAEs**)
* **Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN):** A system of two competing neural networks (a Generator and a Discriminator) that work together to generate new, synthetic data that resembles a given training set.
* **Transformers:** An architecture that relies heavily on self-attention mechanisms to process sequential data. It's the foundation for most modern state-of-the-art NLP models (e.g., **BERT**, **GPT**).

## Transfer Learning
A *strategy*, primarily used in deep learning, where a model trained on one task (e.g., classifying 1000 types of objects in ImageNet) is repurposed for a second, related task (e.g., classifying dog breeds).
* **Using Pre-trained Models:** The core idea is to use an existing, powerful model as a starting point. Popular examples include:
    * **For Vision:** VGG, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet
    * **For Language (NLP):** BERT, GPT-3/4, RoBERTa, T5
* **As a Fixed Feature Extractor:** You "freeze" the weights of the pre-trained model's early layers and only train a new classifier (the final layer) on your specific, smaller dataset.
* **Fine-Tuning:** You "unfreeze" the top few layers of the pre-trained model and re-train them on your new data with a very small learning rate, adapting the learned features to your new task.

---

## Semi-Supervised Learning
A hybrid approach that uses a small amount of labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data for training.
* **Self-Training:** A simple method where a model is first trained on the small labeled dataset. It then makes predictions on the unlabeled data, and the most confident predictions are added as new "pseudo-labels" to the training set. The model is then re-trained.
* **Label Propagation:** A graph-based algorithm that propagates labels from labeled data points to nearby unlabeled data points based on their similarity.
* **Wrapper Methods:** Using an unsupervised clustering algorithm to group data, and then using the small labeled set to assign labels to the clusters.

---

## Self-Supervised Learning (SSL)
A type of unsupervised learning where the data itself provides the supervision. The model is trained on a "pretext" task where the labels are automatically generated from the unlabeled data. This is often a precursor to transfer learning.
* **Masked Autoencoders (MAE):** A technique (common in models like BERT) where parts of the input (e.g., words in a sentence or patches in an image) are masked, and the model must predict the masked parts.
* **Contrastive Learning (e.g., SimCLR, MoCo):** The model learns to pull "similar" (e.g., two augmented versions of the same image) data points closer together in a feature space, while pushing "dissimilar" (e.g., different images) data points farther apart.
* **Noise-based Methods (e.g., Noise2Noise, Noise2Void):** The model is trained to remove artificially added noise from an input, forcing it to learn the underlying structure of the data.
