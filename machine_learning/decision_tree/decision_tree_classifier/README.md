## Decision Tree Classifier

<details>
<summary> What is a Decision Tree Classifier?</summary>
### 🌳 What is a Decision Tree Classifier?

A **Decision Tree Classifier** is like a **flowchart** that helps make decisions by **asking a series of questions** about the data and **splitting** it based on the answers.

---

### 🧠 Think of it Like This:

Imagine you’re trying to **guess an animal**:

* Does it live in water?
  → Yes → Fish
  → No → Next question
* Does it have feathers?
  → Yes → Bird
  → No → Dog

That’s exactly how a **Decision Tree** works — it keeps asking questions until it reaches a final decision (a class).

---

### ⚙️ How it Works (Step-by-Step):

1. **Start with all data** at the root (top of the tree).
2. **Pick the best feature** (question) that divides the data into groups most cleanly.
3. **Split** the data based on that feature (like “yes/no” branches).
4. **Repeat** this process for each branch until:

   * All data in a branch belongs to one class, or
   * A stopping condition is met (like max depth).
5. **Leaf nodes** at the bottom represent the **final predictions** (classes).

---

### 🔍 Example:

| Weather  | Temp | Play? |
| -------- | ---- | ----- |
| Sunny    | Hot  | No    |
| Overcast | Mild | Yes   |
| Rainy    | Cool | Yes   |

The tree might look like:

```
Is Weather = Overcast?
→ Yes → Play = Yes
→ No → Is Weather = Sunny?
     → Yes → Play = No
     → No → Play = Yes
```

---

### 🧮 How It Chooses the Best Split:

The tree tries to make each question **reduce confusion** as much as possible.
It uses measures like:

* **Gini Impurity** or
* **Entropy (Information Gain)**

These measure how **pure** or **mixed** the data is in each branch.

---

### ✅ Advantages:

* Easy to understand and explain (even to non-technical people).
* No need for data scaling or normalization.
* Can handle both numerical and categorical data.

---

### ❌ Disadvantages:

* Can **overfit** (memorize training data).
* Small data changes can change the tree structure.
* Not as accurate alone — often used in **ensembles** (like Random Forests).

---

### 💡 In One Line:

> “A Decision Tree Classifier makes predictions by splitting data into smaller groups based on questions — just like how humans make step-by-step decisions.”

<summary> Entropy, Gini Impurity, Information Gain</summary>
## 🌳 1. ENTROPY

### 🔹 Intuition:

Entropy measures **impurity** or **disorder** in a dataset.

* If all samples belong to **one class** → entropy = 0 (pure).
* If samples are **evenly mixed** → entropy = 1 (maximum disorder).

---

### 🔹 Formula:

```math
H(S) = - \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i \log_2(p_i)
```

### 🔹 Notations:

| Symbol     | Meaning                                                         |
| ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| $H(S)$   | Entropy of the dataset ( S )                                    |
| $c$      | Number of classes                                               |
| $p_i$     | Probability (proportion) of class ( i ) in dataset ( S )        |
| $\log_2$ | Logarithm base 2 (used because information is measured in bits) |

---

### 🔹 Example (Entropy Calculation):

Suppose you have 10 samples:

* 6 are **Positive**
* 4 are **Negative**

```math
p_+ = \frac{6}{10} = 0.6, \quad p_- = \frac{4}{10} = 0.4
```

```math
H(S) = -[0.6 \log_2(0.6) + 0.4 \log_2(0.4)]
```

```math
H(S) = -[0.6(-0.7369) + 0.4(-1.3219)]
```

```math
H(S) = 0.9709 \approx 0.97
```

✅ Interpretation:
Entropy = 0.97 → high disorder → not a pure node.

---

## 🍀 2. GINI IMPURITY

### 🔹 Intuition:

Gini Impurity also measures impurity but with a simpler calculation.
It represents the **probability that a randomly chosen sample would be misclassified** if we label it randomly according to class proportions.

---

### 🔹 Formula:

```math
G(S) = 1 - \sum_{i=1}^{c} p_i^2
```

### 🔹 Notations:

| Symbol   | Meaning                                 |
| -------- | --------------------------------------- |
| $G(S)$ | Gini impurity of dataset ( S )          |
| $c$    | Number of classes                       |
| $p_i$  | Probability (proportion) of class ( i ) |

---

### 🔹 Example (Gini Calculation):

Using same dataset (6 positive, 4 negative):

```math
G(S) = 1 - (0.6^2 + 0.4^2)
```
```math
G(S) = 1 - (0.36 + 0.16)
```
```math
G(S) = 1 - 0.52 = 0.48
```

✅ Interpretation:
Gini = 0.48 → moderately impure.
Gini = 0 means pure, Gini = 0.5 means maximum impurity for 2 classes.

---


## Entropy vs Gini Impurity

### What they *measure* (conceptually)

* **Both** are measures of how “mixed” or **impure** a group of examples is.
* If a node (group) contains only one class, both say “pure” (no impurity). If classes are mixed, both indicate impurity.
* The two measures use slightly different internal logic to judge impurity, so they can prefer slightly different splits — but they are trying to answer the same question: *Which split makes the resulting groups as pure as possible?*

---

### Where they are used (typical algorithms)

* **Entropy** (and Information Gain derived from it) is the splitting criterion behind algorithms in the **ID3** family and is historically used by **C4.5** (and variants).
* **Gini Impurity** is the default split criterion used by **CART** (Classification And Regression Trees) and therefore is what most implementations of decision trees (e.g., many `sklearn` defaults, many Random Forest/CART implementations) use by default.
* In practice, **both** are used inside **Decision Trees** and **ensembles** (Random Forests, GradientBoostedTrees). Ensemble algorithms typically accept either criterion, but many libraries default to Gini.

---

### Practical differences you’ll notice (behavioral)

* **Computation / speed**

  * Gini is slightly cheaper to compute (fewer operations). For large datasets the difference is tiny but measurable.
* **Split choices / tree shape**

  * They often produce *very similar* trees. When they differ, differences are small: Gini tends to emphasize the largest class slightly more, sometimes producing purer splits sooner. Entropy can be a bit more sensitive to changes in class probability and sometimes prefers splits that give a better balance of class probabilities across children.
* **Stability / sensitivity**

  * Neither is dramatically more stable; both can change structure if training data changes. In noisy data, results depend more on pruning/regularization than the choice between the two.
* **Interpretability**

  * Trees from either look and read the same. Choice doesn’t affect how you explain the tree to stakeholders.

---

### When one may be preferable (rules of thumb)

* **Use Gini when**:

  * You want the sensible default — many libraries default to Gini, and most practitioners use it.
  * You care about slightly faster training on large datasets.
  * You’re building many trees in an ensemble (Random Forest), where tiny per-tree speedups add up.
* **Use Entropy (information gain) when**:

  * You want to follow classical ID3/C4.5 methodology or literature that reports results with entropy.
  * You suspect that tracking the change in uncertainty (information-theoretic view) aligns with your domain intuition — e.g., when thinking in terms of information reduction is meaningful to stakeholders.
* **But most of the time**: the choice **doesn’t matter much**. If you need maximum accuracy, compare both with cross-validation — tune other hyperparameters (max depth, min samples per leaf, pruning) first because they usually matter more.

---

### Special cases / dataset characteristics

* **Highly imbalanced classes**

  * Neither metric magically solves imbalance. Use class weighting, sampling, or metrics suited to imbalance. That said, because Gini slightly favors the dominant class it may create splits that isolate minority classes less aggressively — again, difference is small compared to sampling/weighting choices.
* **Many classes (multi-class problems)**

  * Both extend to multi-class naturally. Behavior differences remain small; test if you care.
* **Noisy or small datasets**

  * Regularization (pruning, min samples per leaf) and stable validation are far more important than which impurity measure you use.

---

### Interaction with tree hyperparameters and pruning

* The impurity criterion decides *which* split to try at each node, but **tree complexity and generalization** are controlled by hyperparameters: max depth, minimum samples per split/leaf, pruning strategy, and feature selection.
* In practice, tuning those hyperparameters yields far greater improvements than switching between Gini and Entropy.

---

### Recommendations (practical checklist)

1. **Default to Gini** for speed and because it’s the most common choice.
2. **If following a paper or algorithm that uses Entropy/IG**, use Entropy for reproducibility.
3. **If you want the best accuracy for a specific problem**, try both as part of a small hyperparameter sweep with cross-validation.
4. **Prioritize** tuning max_depth, min_samples_leaf, pruning, class weights, or sampling methods if you see overfitting/imbalance — these matter more than the impurity measure.
5. **For ensembles (Random Forests / GBMs)**: use the library default unless you have evidence to prefer the other; ensemble averaging makes the difference negligible.

---

### Quick analogy to remember

* Think of **Entropy** as "how much surprise or uncertainty is in the node" (information view).
* Think of **Gini** as "how often would you make a mistake if you guessed a random label according to the node’s class proportions" (misclassification chance).
  Both ask “how mixed is this node?” — they just answer with slightly different perspectives.

---

### Short summary (one paragraph)

Entropy and Gini are two impurity measures used to pick splits in decision trees. Entropy comes from information theory (ID3/C4.5 family), while Gini is the default in CART and many practical toolkits. They produce very similar trees; Gini is a tiny bit faster and commonly used by default, while entropy is slightly more sensitive to class probability changes. In real tasks, hyperparameter tuning, pruning, and handling class imbalance matter much more than the choice between them — so default to Gini, but validate both if you want to squeeze out marginal gains.

## 📊 3. INFORMATION GAIN (IG)

### 🔹 Intuition:

Information Gain tells us **how much uncertainty (entropy) is reduced** after splitting the data based on a feature.

Higher IG → Better feature to split on.

---

### 🔹 Formula (Using Entropy):

```math
IG(S, A) = H(S) - \sum_{v \in \text{Values}(A)} \frac{|S_v|}{|S|} H(S_v)
```

### 🔹 Notations:

| Symbol       | Meaning                                              | 
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- | 
| $IG(S, A)$ | Information Gain of attribute ( A ) on dataset ( S ) |
| $H(S)$     | Entropy of parent dataset                            |
| $v$        | Each possible value of attribute ( A )               |
| $S_v$      | Subset of ( S ) where ( A = v )                      |
| H(S_v)   | Entropy of subset ( S_v )                            |  
---

### 🔹 Example (Information Gain):

Suppose we have 10 samples,
6 Yes and 4 No → ( H(S) = 0.97 )

Now split by **Feature = Weather (Sunny or Rainy)**

| Weather | Yes | No | Total | Entropy                                           |
| ------- | --- | -- | ----- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Sunny   | 2   | 3  | 5     | $H_1 = -[0.4\log_2(0.4)+0.6\log_2(0.6)] = 0.97$ |
| Rainy   | 4   | 1  | 5     | $H_2 = -[0.8\log_2(0.8)+0.2\log_2(0.2)] = 0.72$ |

Now calculate weighted entropy after split:

```math
H_{\text{after}} = \frac{5}{10} \times 0.97 + \frac{5}{10} \times 0.72 = 0.845
```

```math
IG(S, \text{Weather}) = H(S) - H_{\text{after}} = 0.97 - 0.845 = 0.125
```

✅ Interpretation:
Information Gain = 0.125
→ This means splitting on *Weather* reduces uncertainty by 0.125 bits.

## 🧠 Tip to Remember (for interviews):

* **Entropy → Disorder (logarithmic)**
* **Gini → Misclassification probability (squared)**
* **Information Gain → Reduction in disorder**
